TikZ is a system for drawing graphics in LaTeX. Over the years I have produced many figures using it. Each time I learn a new technique, I add the corresponding code to a large indexed document. Here is a [copy of the document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamAdamDay/tikz-examples/master/tikz-figures.pdf). Also, find [the code on GitHub](https://github.com/SamAdamDay/tikz-examples).
