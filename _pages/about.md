I am interested in various topics related to ML/AI, specifically graph machine learning
and AI safety. Currently I working as a [postdoctoral
researcher](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/sam.adam-day/) at the Computer Science
Department of the University of Oxford with [Michael
Benedikt](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.benedikt/).

Check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/SamAdamDay).

The following are broadly my current research interests. See also my [list of
publications](/publications).
- Multi-agent cooperation
- Graph machine learning
- Active learning with large language models
- Logic/set theory
