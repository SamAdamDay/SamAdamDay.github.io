I am interested in various topics related to ML/AI, specifically AI safety. Currently I am in my final of a PhD at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) of the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).

Check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/SamAdamDay).

The following are broadly my current research interests. See also my [list of publications](/publications).
- Multi-agent cooperation
- Graph machine learning
- Active learning with large language models
- Logic/set theory
