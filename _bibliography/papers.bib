  abstract = {An \(\mathbb R\)-tree is a certain kind of metric space tree in which every point can be branching. Favre and Jonsson posed the following problem in 2004: can the class of orders underlying \(\mathbb R\)-trees be characterised by the fact that every branch is order-isomorphic to a real interval? In the first part, I answer this question in the negative: there is a 'branchwise-real tree order' which is not `continuously gradable'. In the second part, I show that a branchwise-real tree order is continuously gradable if and only if every well-stratified subtree is \(\mathbb R\)-gradable. This link with set theory is put to work in the third part answering refinements of the main question, yielding several independence results. For example, when \(\kappa \geq \mathfrak c\), there is a branchwise-real tree order which is not continuously gradable, and which satisfies a property corresponding to \(\kappa\)-separability. Conversely, under Martin's Axiom at \(\kappa\) such a tree does not exist.}

  abstract = {A branchwise-real tree order is a partial order tree in which every branch is isomorphic to a real interval. I give constructions of such trees which are both rigid (i.e. without non-trivial order-automorphisms) and uniform (in two different senses). Specifically, I show that there is a rigid branchwise-real tree order in which every branching point has the same degree, one in which every point is branching and of the same degree, and finally one in which every point is branching of the same degree and which admits no order-preserving function into the reals. Trees are grown iteratively in stages, and a key technique is the construction (in ZFC) of a family of colourings of \((0,\infty)\) which is 'sufficiently generic', using these colourings to determine how to proceed with the construction.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
